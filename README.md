"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."

### Overview:
"easy-first-contribution" is a GitHub repository designed to help GitHub users to *quickly and easily* get their first contribution to an open-source project "in the bag." The first pull request is often a bit "scary" for first timers and the aim of this repo is to make it super easy for anyone to practice a real live pull request with minimal thinking as to the content of the change. Just add your favorite quote and your username!

### What the heck is a pull request?
A pull request, or sometimes called a "merge request," is just a way of you saying to the maintainers of a repo "will you pull in my changes? 

### How do I create a pull request?
See here: TODO

### How Do I Start?
Just add your favorite quotation and your GitHub username to "quotes.json". Submit your changes through a pull request and you're done! You've just contributed to an open-source project!

### Motivation:
When I was making my first proper GitHub contribution, I found myself looking for GitHub repos that (1) had issues that were "Up-For-Grabs" and (2) had issues that matched my skillset. The problem was that the combination of (1) and (2) made successfully making my first contribution much more cumbersome than I would have liked.
